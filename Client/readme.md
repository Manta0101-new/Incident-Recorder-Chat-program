The chat client comes in two varieties: the python version of the chat client and the Windows .net 8  version of the client. The reason for this is to allow the use of some functionality from windows to be added to make it more user friendly.  The Python version is more portable and only requires PIL (pillow) and Tkinter  modules. Which can be used on multiple platforms.
